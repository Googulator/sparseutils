sparsemap tests
===============

Please note that these tests will depend very much on the file
system, it is up to the file system to decide how many zeroes
are required before it decides to represent the hole as an actual
hole rather than just a run of zeroes.

At time of writing (2017) these tests pass on ext4,
where the default block size is 4096 bytes.

    SCENARIO sparsemap single data followed by single hole
       GIVEN a sparse file S with a hole size 4096 and data size 8192 with spec data,hole
        WHEN we run sparsemap on S
        THEN stdout contains exactly DATA 8192\nHOLE 4096

    SCENARIO sparsemap single hole followed by single data
       GIVEN a sparse file S with a hole size 4096 and data size 8192 with spec hole,data
        WHEN we run sparsemap on S
        THEN stdout contains exactly HOLE 4096\nDATA 8192

    SCENARIO sparsemap hole followed by data followed by hole
       GIVEN a sparse file S with a hole size 8192 and data size 4096 with spec hole,data,hole
        WHEN we run sparsemap on S
        THEN stdout contains exactly HOLE 8192\nDATA 4096\nHOLE 8192

    SCENARIO tiny hole can look like data
       GIVEN a sparse file S with a hole size 6 and data size 4096 with spec hole,data,hole
        WHEN we run sparsemap on S
        THEN stdout contains exactly DATA 4108

    SCENARIO sparsemap data followed by hole followed by data
       GIVEN a sparse file S with a hole size 8192 and data size 4096 with spec data,hole,data
        WHEN we run sparsemap on S
        THEN stdout contains exactly DATA 4096\nHOLE 8192\nDATA 4096

    SCENARIO sparsemap sequence of holes
       GIVEN a sparse file S with a hole size 4096 and data size 8192 with spec data,hole,hole,data
        WHEN we run sparsemap on S
        THEN stdout contains exactly DATA 8192\nHOLE 8192\nDATA 8192

    SCENARIO sparsemap sequence of holes (ending with hole)
       GIVEN a sparse file S with a hole size 8192 and data size 4096 with spec data,hole,hole,hole
        WHEN we run sparsemap on S
        THEN stdout contains exactly DATA 4096\nHOLE 24576

    SCENARIO sparsemap file with only data
       GIVEN a sparse file S with a hole size 8192 and data size 4096 with spec data
        WHEN we run sparsemap on S
        THEN stdout contains exactly DATA 4096

    SCENARIO sparsemap file with only hole
       GIVEN a sparse file S with a hole size 8192 and data size 4096 with spec hole
        WHEN we run sparsemap on S
        THEN stdout contains exactly HOLE 8192

    SCENARIO sparsemap file with data,hole,data,hole,data
       GIVEN a sparse file S with a hole size 8192 and data size 4096 with spec data,hole,data,hole,data
        WHEN we run sparsemap on S
        THEN stdout contains exactly DATA 4096\nHOLE 8192\nDATA 4096\nHOLE 8192\nDATA 4096

    SCENARIO sparsemap file with hole,data,hole,data,hole
       GIVEN a sparse file S with a hole size 8192 and data size 4096 with spec hole,data,hole,data,hole
        WHEN we run sparsemap on S
        THEN stdout contains exactly HOLE 8192\nDATA 4096\nHOLE 8192\nDATA 4096\nHOLE 8192

Generic commandline handling stuff,

    SCENARIO sparsemap errs on no FILE arg
        WHEN we attempt to run sparsemap without any arguments
        THEN the exit code is 2

    SCENARIO sparsemap errs if more than one arg
        WHEN we attempt to run sparsemap on S T
        THEN the exit code is 2
