mksparse tests
==============

mksparse is mostly tested by the sparsemap tests, but these yarns
will just make sure that basic command line handling is working.

    SCENARIO error if no output file
        WHEN we attempt to run mksparse without any arguments
        THEN the exit code is 2

    SCENARIO error if more than one output file
        WHEN we attempt to run mksparse with S T
        THEN the exit code is 2

    SCENARIO error if bad options
        WHEN we attempt to run mksparse with --explode-kittens S
        THEN the exit code is 2
