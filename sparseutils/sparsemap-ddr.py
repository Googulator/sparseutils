DESCRIPTION = '''Print a ddrescue-compatible map of a sparse file to stdout.

The file is interpreted as a sequence of data and holes, for example
given a file with 8192 bytes of data followed by a 4096 byte hole followed
by 8192 bytes of data the output of sparsemap would be:

0x00000000 ? 1
0x00000000 0x00002000 +
0x00002000 0x00001000 ?
0x00003000 0x00002000 +

This format is directly usable by the ddrescue utility as a domain mapfile.
